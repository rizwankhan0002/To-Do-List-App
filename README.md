# To-Do-List-App
In this we have create a To-Do list web app (Task App) using react JS and tailwind CSS. This react ToDo app contains a input field, so that user can enter their task. Then the task will be added in the list.
When user click on any task (or any to-do list) then it will be marked a completed or incomplete task. User can also delete the to-do items from the list using the delete icon (bin icon).
This To-Do Task list will be saved in the browser, so that when we open the browser again we will find all our saved To-Do list / task list. To design this React App we will use Tailwind CSS.
